Scenario Description
--------------------

Continuous Attractor Neural Networks (CANN) is a powerful neural dynamics model capable of characterizing continuous state variables (such as position, direction, etc.) by forming "bump" activity patterns. This series of tutorials will teach you how to:

- Understand the basic dynamics principles of CANN
- Analyze how different inputs affect bump formation and movement
- Visualize and analyze the response characteristics of CANN
- Explore the influence of model parameters on dynamics behavior

What You Will Learn
-------------------

Through this series of tutorials, you will master:

1. Setup and basic **tracking tasks in 1D CANN**
2. **Spatial encoding in 2D CANN** and animation visualization
3. **Computation and analysis methods of tuning curves**
4. **Implementation and application scenarios of oscillatory tracking**
