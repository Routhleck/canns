Spatial Navigation Modeling
============================

Scene Description
-----------------

Spatial navigation is one of the most important functions of the brain. This series of tutorials will teach you how to use CANN models and hierarchical neural networks to simulate the brain's spatial navigation system, including:

- Multi-scale representation of grid cells
- Spatial encoding of place cells
- The role of theta rhythm in navigation
- Path integration and trajectory tracking mechanisms

What You Will Learn
-------------------

1. Simple path integration mechanisms
2. Construction of hierarchical neural networks (stripe cells, grid cells, place cells)
3. Implementation of theta rhythm modulation
4. Navigation simulation in complex environments
