Scenario 2: Data Analysis and Neural Decoding
==============================================

.. note::
   **Coming Soon**

   This section is under development. Tutorials on analyzing experimental neural data,
   decoding spatial representations, and validating model predictions will be added soon.

Planned Topics
--------------

The Data Analysis scenario will cover:

- Loading and preprocessing experimental neural recordings
- Analyzing firing rate patterns and tuning curves
- Decoding position from neural activity
- Comparing model predictions with experimental data
- Statistical validation and hypothesis testing

Stay tuned for updates!
